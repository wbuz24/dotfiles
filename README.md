# Dotfiles repository

For more information on a dotfile repository and why you may be interested in one, I recommend this [webpage](https://geekdude.github.io/tech/dotfiles/) by Dr. Aaron Young.

# Structure

This repository holds my dotfiles and removes the '.' so that they are visible. Therefore, the dot will need to be added to each file.

For setup, this bash script will build an old_dotfiles folder and move things appropriately, this will be a hidden folder, so keep note
```
sh setup.sh
```
